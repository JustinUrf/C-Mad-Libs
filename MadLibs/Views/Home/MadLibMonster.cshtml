    <h1>A monster from afar @Model.Monster</h1>
    <p>@Model.Name, you have fallen into a dark abyss and you realize your legs are broken.</p>
    <p>Off in the distsance, you see a @Model.Verb creature. Unable to discern what it is. You see a hint of @Model.Color</p>
    <p>In cold sweats you start to crawl your way over to safety, but realize the there is a @Model.Adj swamp in your way.</p>
    <p>You realize you can only fight. You pull a @Model.Noun out of your pocket and prepare to fight.</p>
    <p>You fought valiantly against a @Model.Color @Model.Monster and die. Unlucky</p>
    <p>It's all ogre now.</p>
